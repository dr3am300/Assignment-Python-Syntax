# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.
# Task 1: Grocery Store Math
# Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. 
# For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? 
# Prices don't need to be realistic

bread = 5
peanut_butter = 3
jelly = 2
total = bread + peanut_butter + jelly
print(total)

# Task 2: Bank Interest
# If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. 
# So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. 
# For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

initial_amount = 10000
interest_rate = 0.07
total_amount = initial_amount + (initial_amount * interest_rate)
print(total_amount)
